    <h2>Why Green Minds?</h2>
    <p>
      Farming requires immense dedication, hard work, and resilience. Yet, farmers worldwide face unpredictable weather, financial instability, crop failure, and market fluctuations. These ongoing pressures deeply affect their mental health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many farmers experience stress, anxiety, depression, and sadly, sometimes suicidal thoughts. Due to stigma, isolation, and limited mental health services in rural areas, these problems often go unaddressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supporting farmers’ mental well-being is crucial. Increasing awareness, providing access to counseling, and building strong support communities can save lives. Governments and agricultural bodies must prioritize this. A healthy farmer is just as important as a healthy crop.
